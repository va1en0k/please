# please tool (pyplease)

## What and why?

I'm going to write a blog post about it. Please stay tuned at [[http://unfoldthat.com]]

## Install

Please use

    $ sudo pip install -e git://github.com/va1en0k/please.git#egg=please

to install please.

After installing please run `please please configure`. It will configure autocompletion, default modules, etc.

You'll need to run `source ~/.bashrc` or restart bash session to enable autocompletion!

Please use `please` as you please. With autocompletion it's simple.

To get help:

Try `please`

Try `please [module_name]`, like `please ssh` or `please git`.

Explore.

I'm going to add action `configure` to as many modules as possible, it will interactively configure a program with several options I find useful and cool.

`please git configure` and `please please configure` are already working.

I like the first one because git annoys me.
